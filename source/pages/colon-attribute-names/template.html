<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>
  Using colons to start web component attribute
  names makes them quick to type and easy to ingest.
</p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  I've been thinking about easier ways to get
  at attributes. I'm looking for two things:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The ability to run a single function to 
    load them all in at once
  </li>
  <li>
    A way to avoid collisions with standard
    HTML attribute names (e.g. if I want to use
    <code>class</code> to store a value
    for the component instead of it being
    used to define CSS classes)
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  I've been using <code>data-*</code> attributes.
  They avoid the name collisions by default.
  With a basic function to slurp them all up 
  at the same time, they satisfy both requirements. 
</p>
<p>
  But, they're kinda ugly. 
</p>
<p>
  And, it feels super repetitive to have
  to prepend everything with the 
  <code>data-</code> string.
</p>
<p>
  For example, this isn't bad, but it's not
  great:

<h2>Enter The Colon</h2>

<p>
  According to 
  <a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-LC/syntax.html#attributes-0">the W3C HTML spec</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Attribute names must consist of one or more 
  characters other than the space characters, 
  U+0000 NULL, U+0022 QUOTATION MARK (&quot;), 
  U+0027 APOSTROPHE ('), U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN (&gt;), 
  U+002F SOLIDUS (/), and U+003D EQUALS SIGN (=) characters, 
  the control characters, and any characters that are not 
  defined by Unicode.
</blockquote>

<p>
  And, according to 
  <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#attributes-2">the WHATWG HTML Living Standard</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Attribute names must consist of one or more characters other than 
  controls, U+0020 SPACE, U+0022 (&quot;), U+0027 ('), 
  U+003E (&gt;), U+002F (/), U+003D (=), and noncharacters.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Regardless of which one you pick, we can use 
  characters other than letters to start 
  attribute names. I've started using the colon
  and really like the way it looks.

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    This approach lower cases string before 
    checking the list of attributes for the name. 
    As a result, <em>camelCase</em> names (or
    other names with capital letters) won't 
    be found. 
  </li>
</ul>
