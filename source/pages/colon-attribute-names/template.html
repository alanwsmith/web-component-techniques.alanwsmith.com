<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>
  Using colons to start web component attribute
  names makes them quick to type and easy to ingest.
  There's a full example at the end of this post
  if you want to skip to that. Totally 
  a personal preference thing, but you may like
  it too.
</p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  I've been thinking about easier ways to get
  at attributes. I'm looking for two things:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The ability to run a single function to 
    load them all in at once
  </li>
  <li>
    A way to avoid collisions with standard
    HTML attribute names (e.g. if I want to use
    <code>class</code> to store a value
    for the component instead of it being
    used to define CSS classes)
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  I've been using <code>data-*</code> attributes.
  They avoid the name collisions by default.
  With a basic function to slurp them all up 
  at the same time, they satisfy both requirements. 
</p>
<p>
  But, they're kinda ugly. 
</p>
<p>
  And, it feels super repetitive to have
  to prepend everything with the 
  <code>data-</code> string.
</p>
<p>
  For example, this isn't bad, but it's not
  great:

<h2>Enter The Colon</h2>

<p>
  According to 
  <a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-LC/syntax.html#attributes-0">the W3C HTML spec</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Attribute names must consist of one or more 
  characters other than the space characters, 
  U+0000 NULL, U+0022 QUOTATION MARK (&quot;), 
  U+0027 APOSTROPHE ('), U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN (&gt;), 
  U+002F SOLIDUS (/), and U+003D EQUALS SIGN (=) characters, 
  the control characters, and any characters that are not 
  defined by Unicode.
</blockquote>

<p>
  And, according to 
  <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#attributes-2">the WHATWG HTML Living Standard</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Attribute names must consist of one or more characters other than 
  controls, U+0020 SPACE, U+0022 (&quot;), U+0027 ('), 
  U+003E (&gt;), U+002F (/), U+003D (=), and noncharacters.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Regardless of which one you pick, we can use 
  characters other than letters to start 
  attribute names. I've started using the colon
  and really like the way it looks.

<h2>Slurping The Attributes</h2>

<p>
  Prepending attribute names with the colon eliminates
  name collision issues. It also gives us a nice 
  thing to target for writing an ingestion function. 
  We can loop through all the attributes and pull
  out just the ones we want using it as a filter. 
</p>

<p>
  For example:
</p>

<pre><code>
[@ page.highlighted_component(14, 23) @]
</pre></code>

<p>
  We can then access the values doing
  something like this:
</p>

<pre><code>
[@ page.highlighted_component(25, 37) @]
</pre></code>

<p>
  Which gives us this:
</p>

[@ page.display_snippet("3.html") @]

<h2>Full Sample</h2>

<p>
  Here's a complete sample 
  with all the parts baked in. 
</p>



<pre><code>[@ page.highlighted_component() @]</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  There's no particular technical reason 
  I'm using the colon instead of something else.
  I just think it looks nice and gives
  me a clean identifier for my 
  component's attributes.

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    This approach lower cases string before 
    checking the list of attributes for the name. 
    As a result, <code>camelCase</code> names (or
    other names with capital letters) won't 
    be found. There are ways around that, but
    I just stick with <code>kebab-case</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
